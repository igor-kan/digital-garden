point-like object in physics 
[[terminal object]] of [[pointed object ]]

the below matryoshka ill-founded pure set theory?
[[true]]
[[singleton]]
[[terminal category]]


material point(for marking out) vs. mathematical point 

`material space vs. mathematical space ?`
`if mathematical point, line, plane, and space(?) do not occupy material space and are not material space. only in mathematical space?`

`Euclidean geometrical point vs. non-Euclidean`
`mathematical points cannot inhabit material space? the issues seem the same as in real/material space`
[[singleton]]

`some convention needed for 0-ary operation?`

`if mathematical point not a place in lived space, what is that space? the location in the lived space is defined/established by identifying in real life, e.g. pointing? a place defined non-mathematically '  
` dimensionless objects cannot have location in lived space? dimensionless objects in physics?`

- `does signularity exist just because of mathematical point vs actual place?`

# Notes

``` ad-note

If a point does not occupy space, how can it be located _in_ space? How can a spatial nothing designate one bit of space rather than another bit of space? How can we say that one point in space is such and such a distance from another?
	``by [[formalism interpretation]], axioms like points in space of meaning? Being designated by such a mark is the most obvious way in which a point borrows space from something else in order to be located in space?? mark allows pt to be located in space actually? ``
