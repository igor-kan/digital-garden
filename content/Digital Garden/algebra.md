$\mathscr{A} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{X})$

properties
1. $\emptyset, \mathbb{X} \in \mathscr{A}$
2. closed under complementation 
3. closed under finite union 

$\forall i \in \mathbb{N}, \mathscr{A}_{i}$ satisfy a property $, \bigcap^{\infty}_{i=1} \mathscr{A}_{i}$ is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra satisfying a property

$\sigma(\mathscr{C})= \bigcap^{\infty}_{i=1} \mathscr{A}_{i}\text{ such that } \mathscr{C} \subseteq \mathscr{A}_{i}$  

$\sigma (\mathscr{C})\subseteq \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{X})$ is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra containing collection $\mathscr{C}$



# $\sigma$-algebra 

3. $\sigma$-additivity closed under countable union


# Borel $\sigma$-algebra 
$\mathscr{B}(\mathbb{X})=\sigma(\mathcal{T}_{\mathbb{X}})$
