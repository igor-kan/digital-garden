Defined on $[0,1]$, this function is continuous, increasing, and maps $[0,1]$ onto $[0,1]$. Its derivative exists and is zero on the complement of the Cantor set in $[0,1]$, which has measure 1.
  Let $\psi(x) = \varphi(x) + x$ for all $x \in [0, 1]$, where $\varphi$ is the Cantor-Lebesgue function. Then $\psi$ is strictly increasing and continuous, mapping $[0,1]$ onto $[0,2]$, the Cantor set $C$ onto a measurable set of positive measure, and a measurable subset of $C$ onto a nonmeasurable set.
