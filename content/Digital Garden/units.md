### 1. Temperature

### K is generally used for temperature. Absolute zero is defined with K as 0 (-273°C, -459.67°F), and the magnitude of K and the degree Celsius are equal.

### 2. Mass

kg and g is used for mass. Pounds and kilograms are converted as follows. 1 lb = 0.453 592 37kg, 1kg = 2.2046 lb

### 3. Distance

m and km are generally used for distance. 1km is equal to 0.62 mile, and 1 mile is equal to 1.609 km. 1 m is 1/1000 of a km, and 1 cm is 1/100 of a m. Going further, km3 and L (1000 cm3) are used for volume, and km2 for surface area. For atomic scales, Å (1x10-10m) is used.

Below are some derived units.

### 4. Pressure

GPa is sued for pressure. 1GPa=1000 MPa, which is equal to about 10,000x the atmospheric pressure. 1bar = 0.1MPa≈14.5 psi (≈1 atm).

That concludes the introduction of the units which will be used in this course. Think of it as getting used to them, rather than learning them.
