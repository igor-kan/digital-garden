- drilling 
	- outer crust layer 
	- 12.262 km deep hole on Russia’s Kola Peninsula 
		- world record drilling depth 
		- from 1970 to 1992
		- planned to dig to 15km, but the temperature in the earth reached 180°C(relatively small but hinders excavation) at 12km
		- The boundary between granite and basalt was surpassed, but they were unable to cross the earth crust/mantle boundary.

	- “Chikyu” project
		- with the goal of reaching the mantle by digging through the thin oceanic crust.

- ophiolite rocks 
	- have been driven up to the surface by past crustal movements.
	- from 20 or 30 km deep

- xenolith rocks 
	- gets carried along by rising magma. In many cases it has been altered by heat, but not always.
	- deduce the chemical composition of the upper mantle

- further direction
	- impurities in diamonds contain components from the lower mantle which are thought to have been made at a depth of 400-800km
