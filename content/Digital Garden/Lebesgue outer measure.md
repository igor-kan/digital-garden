[[length]]

Lebesgue outer measure on the real line 
$\mu^*:\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{X})\rightarrow[0,\infty]$
`on power set? or sigma-alg`
$I$ arbitrary(open, closed, or half-open) bounded interval on the real line `needs to be bounded for 1.?`

properties:
1. $\mu^*(I)=\mathscr{l}(I)=b-a$ given by the [[length]]
2. translation invariant 
3. countably subadditive 


other 
monotonicity
