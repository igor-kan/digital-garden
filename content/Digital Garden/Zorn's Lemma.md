Zorn’s lemma is a particularly useful form of the axiom of choice, especially for algebraic  
applications. Readers who want to learn more about Zorn’s lemma and its applications to  
algebra should consult either Lang [109], Appendix 2, §2 (pp. 878-884) and Chapter III,  
§5 (pp. 139-140), or Artin [7], Appendix §1 (pp. 588-589). For the logical ramifications  
of Zorn’s lemma and its equivalence with the axiom of choice, one should consult Schwartz  
[150], (Vol. 1), Chapter I, §6, or a text on set theory such as Enderton [56], Suppes [173], or  
Kuratowski and Mostowski [108].
Proof. See any of Schwartz [150], Enderton [56], Suppes [173], or Kuratowski and Mostowski
