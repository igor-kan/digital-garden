# Notation and terminology 
"set" and "is a member of" membership are primitive notions; no mathematical definition. 


$\emptyset$ or $\{\}$  ->[[mathematics/empty set]] [empty-set] 
$\neq \emptyset$ -> nonempty set 
$\{ x \}$ -> singleton set with one member 
$2^X$ or $\mathcal{P}(X)$ -> the power set - the set of all subsets of X 
 $x\in A$  or $A \ni x$ -> x is a member [point, element, object] of set A

$A$ -> capital Latin letter convention for sets
$\mathcal{A}$ -> capital Latin letter in calligraphic font for collection [set, family] of sets

$\{a,b,c,\cdots\}$ -> set definition by enumeration of elements
$\{x \in A \vert property \}$  -> set definition by property, proposition, "set of all elements in A that satisfy the property"
$\vert$ or $:$ -> s.t. or such that in set notation 

$\ni$ or $s.t.$ -> such that 

set equivalence 
- number of distinct elements is the same - both contain the same exact kinds of elements 
- number of non-distinct repetitions may differ, unlike [[list]]

$A\subseteq U$ (negation $\nsubseteq$ ) -> inclusion: $A \in B \iff x \in A \Rightarrow$
$A\subsetneq U$ or $\subset$ -> proper inclusion 
A = B -> 
$A^c$ or $X \sim A$ or $X - A$ or $X \backslash A$ -> the complement of A in(or with respect to) X (if X - the reference set and all sets are its subsets, then "the complement of A") 

complement 
absolute complement 

disjoint 
- pairwise disjoint implies disjoint 

The partition of a set is a collection of disjoint subsets of a set whose unions is the entire set. 

finite union 
countable union 
arbitrary union 

finite intersection 
countable intersection 
arbitrary intersection 

De Morgan's identities(or laws) 

$A=\{ x_{\lambda} \vert \lambda \in \Lambda \} = \{ x_{\lambda} \}_{\lambda \in \Lambda}$ -> an indexing (parametrization) of A by the indexing(parameter) set
