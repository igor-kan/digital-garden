# Ch 1
## 1.1,2
	colliders in Geneva, fermilab

why functions always written y=f(x) or x=x(t) 
trajectory only in the actual space of travel or on r vs graph too?

t2>t1 condition   in average velocity 
time is always measured forward? even for reverse process 1-t? 
usu. t=0 interpretation 

how many number of derivatives can be taken of a function?

argument vs paremeter 
arbitrary - math def
describe a body = describe its position (kinematics)

initial conditions similarity w/ wave equation etc. 

1.16: position eq -> deriv velocity -> solve for t and sub

1.17 instead of expanding square, factor out term in square

correspond to vs. depend on? 

magnitude, norm of vector depends on choice of basis? esp. if base vectors are not unit vectors or should they be unit vectors? 

effective = actual, net

as measured from = as measured by an observer at = relative to 

depend on = vary with = `correspond to ?` = proportional to

Euler-Lagrange equation
- momentum

Lagrangian 
$\mathcal{L}=KE-PE$
$L=T-V$
$L(x(t), \dot{x}(t), t)$

Hamiltonian
$\mathcal{H}=KE+PE$??
$H=T+V$

$S=\int^{t_{2}}_{t_{1}}L(x, \dot{x},t) dt$

# Jokes 
if you’re a pediatrician, you will understand why your patient will not sit still: the laws of quantum mechanics don’t allow a very small object to have a
definite position and momentum.

You cannot say, “I will look it up.” Your birthday and social security number are things you look up; trigonometric
functions and identities are what you know all the time.
