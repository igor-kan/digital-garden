# An introduction to thermal physics
[Zotero Link](zotero://select/items/@Schroeder2021_IntroductionThermalPhysics) - [DOI Link](https://doi.org/) - [Web]()


# Chapter 1: The First Law 
## Intro
- introduces the concepts of heat, work, temperature, etc.
- the law of energy conservation and application to thermodynamic systems.
[[thermal physics]]
systems - collections `sets?` of large number of particles, i.e. 10^23 and more
electrons in the  chunk of metal, the air in a balloon, the water in a lake, the photons given off by the sun
	photon - electromagnetic wave packet
anything that can be seen with naked eye or even a conventional microscope has enough particles

instead of following the motion of every particle in detail, we 
- assume particles move/jostly about randomly`(?), (and freely?)`
- use the laws of probability/statistics to show connection/infer smth about 10^23 particles and one randomly moving particle OR instead measure the bulk properties to infer smth about the props and behavior of particles.

ex. 1E23 conduction electrons and 1E23 ions in the chunk of metal
- bulk properties of the metal: magnetization, stiffness, conductivity, heat capacity, etc.
- the properties, behavior of constituting particles


Application: [[engineering]], [[environmental science]], [[earth science]], [[low-temperature physics]], [[solid state physics]], [[cosmology]], [[astrophysics]], [[meteorology]], [[geology]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], 

[[thermodynamics]]
the properties of bulk matter that don't apparently depend on the microscopic behavior, atomic physics, i.e. the results such as
- heat always flows from a hot object to a colder one and never in other direction.
- liquids boil more readily under lower pressure
- the maximum possible efficiency of an engine, working over a given temperature range, is the same regardless of what working substance it uses, e.g. air, steam, etc.
these results and the principles that generalize them comprise the subject of thermodynamics


usu. suffices for: [[engineering]], [[earth science]]
- less mathematically demanding
- more readily applied to the everyday world
[[statistical mechanics]]
understanding of the quantum behavior and the laws of statistics to make connection between 1 and 10^23 
apart from predicting the properties/behavior of the large N of particles and bulk props of the matter, it gives the underlying explanation for the TD principles. answers Why? of the key results. 


essential for: [[solid state physics]], [[astrophysics]]
- more math demanding
- gives a concrete foundation in atomic physics, `and quantum?`
- detailed predictions 

## Textbook organization
### Content
Part 1 - Chapters 1-2: The fundamental principles of thermal physics - 1st and 2nd law of TD, alternating between the microscopic and the macroscopic perspectives with some application examples chosen for illustrative character.

Part 2 - Chapters 3-5(?): The development of more advanced techniques for application of TD

Part 3 - Chapters 6-8: The development of more advanced techniques for application of SM

Includes in-text references and at the end of the book for further reading if some topics are not covered or covered superficially. 

Book intended primarily for a one-semester, first course in thermal physics with equal treatment of both TD and SM(not entrenched at only one of these). But actually, content is almost for 2 semesters, so can skip some sections in the one semester. 
	Ex. author's been omitting Sections 1.7, 4.3, 4.4, 5.4 through 5.6, and all of  
	Chapter 8. Many other portions of Parts II and III make equally good candidates  
	for omission, depending on the emphasis of the course.

No references and credit given to the originators of an idea(b/c author says he's unqualified to state who deserves it). The only historical comments in text say how thing could have happened but not necessarily how they did happen.
### problems
The time required per problem differs by 3 orders of magnitude. 

Problem types: thought questions, short numerical calculations, order-of-magnitude estimates, derivations, extensions of theory, extended problems, new applications, problems requiring computer. 

At the very least read all the problems to see what now you can do and what you are missing if you skip a problem.

Operational def of temp and def of op. def.

example of measuring temp of the soup

Explanation of the procedure of measuring temp with thermometer as it realies on the two objects in contact coming to the same temperature after long enough time, they are said to be in thermal equilibrium

```
relaxation time can be appliedd for other equillibria or combinations of equilibria?
```

`heat vs radiant energy, i.e. em waves`

	"contact" can involve em waves and radiation too as energy exchange?

```
the "contact" (thermal?) requires means for spontaneous transfer of energy in the form of heat 

are EM waves energy form - sublclass of heat energy transferred via radiation? or are EM radiation a separate/different form of energy that flows spontaneously?

can thermal insulation be classified into conduction, convection, radiation types? 

how is insulation against radiation made? what are examples?

# Chapter 2: The Second Law 
## Intro
- addresses questions like:
	- The exact, precise definition of temperature.
	- Making precise some ideas of thermal physics.
	- Why the heat flows spontaneously from a hot object to a colder one, and never in reverse? 
	- In general, why do many thermodynamic processes occur in one direction and never the reverse?


When the heat flows flows spontaneously from a hot object to a colder one, the energy is moving more or less randomly.

How do we describe the evolution of a system in contact with a reservoir at fixed T? Change in Helmholtz free energy is leq 0. -> Ch 6 

Z counts accessible microstates at T and evolution follows F
$\widetilde{F}=-kTlnZ$ is tilde F = F?
 $\Omega$ counts accessible microstates at U and evolution follows S
$S=kln\Omega$

f,g are the same functions if they obey the same differential equation with the same initial conditions.

Describe a specific question you have about a problem from Chapter 1: Sections 1 - 6. Make sure to include the number of the problem. Your question must demonstrate some knowledge and familiarity with the material as well as provide some proof that you have actually attempted the problem.

1.55(c) By modelling star as a gas of particles interacting gravitationally and using the virial theorem, we obtain the total energy as the negative total kinetic energy which is expressed in term of the 3 kinetic degrees of freedom and the average temperature by equipartition theorem. If we assume the constant volume, we calculate negative heat capacity, so taking energy out increases temperature.

Is this entirely b/c virial theorem, and that taking energy from hydrogen lowers its "orbit" increasing its velocity/temperature?

For heat capacity, is the assumption that work is zero true for star expanding into vacuum?

Describe a specific point, concept, idea, or mathematical technique you learned while solving a problem from Chapter 1: Sections 1 - 6. Make sure to include the number of the problem. Your answer must demonstrate some knowledge and familiarity with the material as well as provide some proof that you have actually solved the problem.

1.8(c) To show that volume expansion coefficient of a solid can be expressed in terms of 3 linear expansion coefficients of three dimensions, we can find an expression for the change in volume by omitting the changes on the edges(or including them in the limit of low temperature change since coefficients also well-defined), solving for linear change in terms of coefficients and substituting them. But the useful mathematical technique is to simply write volume coefficient in terms of partial derivative with respect to temperature having pressure constant; then substituting lengths, using product and chain rule for 3 dimensions.

2.42(b)The entropy in fundamental units should be of order of the number of particles. So the entropy of the black hole must be of order of the number of particles that have been used to make it or more from the second law of thermodynamics. But why does entropy has preference for the maximum number of particles, especially given that to compress the maximum possible number of particles into a black hole one needs massless particles with the lowest possible energy, e.g. long-wavelength photons. Does it also mean no mass is added, and hence not entropy?

2.24 We derived multiplicity function of two-state paramagnet within x from the peak( x << the total number of dipoles, N). By using Stirling's approximation multiplicity, invoking vicinity condition, and multiple approximations for logarithms including Taylor expansion of logarithm and omitting terms due to relative size, we obtain Gaussian function. Important point: the distribution is used to quantify what outcome is surprising for similar two-state models. In (d) Gaussian is decreases by factor of e at 707 from the peak so having 1000 heads more than tails in one million coin tosses is not that surprising in comparison to 10000.
