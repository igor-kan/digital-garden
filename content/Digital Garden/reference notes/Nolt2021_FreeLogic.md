**Abstract:** Classical logic requires each singular term to denote an object in thedomain of quantification—which is usually understood as the setof “existing” objects. Free logic does not. Free logic istherefore useful for analyzing discourse containing singular termsthat either are or might be empty. A term is empty if it either has noreferent or refers to an object outside the domain., Most free logics have been first-order, their quantifiers ranging overindividuals. Recently, however, some work on higher-order free logicshas appeared. Corine Besson (2009) argues that internalist theories ofnatural kinds require second-order free logics whose quantifiers rangeover kinds, and she finds precedent for this idea ranging as far backas Cocchiarella (1986). Andrew Bacon, John Hawthorne, and GabrielUzquiano (2016) explore the possibility of using a higher-order freelogic to resolve certain intensional paradoxes, but they find thatthis idea faces daunting difficulties. Timothy Williamson (2016)reluctantly concurs. This article, however, focuses mainly onfirst-order logics., Section 1 lays out the basics of free logic, explaining how it differsfrom classical predicate logic and how it is related to inclusivelogic, which permits empty domains or “worlds.” Section 2shows how free logic may be represented by each of three formalmethods: axiom systems, natural deduction rules and tree rules.Varying conventions for calculating the truth values of atomicformulas containing empty singular terms yield three distinct forms offree logic: negative, positive and neutral. These are surveyed inSection 3, along with supervaluations, which were developed to augmentneutral logics. Section 4 is critical, examining three anomalies thatinfect most free logics. Section 5 samples applications of free logicto theories of description, logics of partial or non-strict functions,logics with Kripke semantics, logics of fiction and logics that are ina certain sense Meinongian. Section 6 takes a glance at freelogic’s history.
