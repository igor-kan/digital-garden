# Intro 
[[Apollonius's identity ]]
$$a^2+b^2=\frac{1}{2}c^2+2d^2$$
which has long Euclidean geometry proof but also follows from the inner products properties `?`

# Ch 1
Ren√© Descartes
vector space 

`(content), as published by ... in ..`




subspaces to vector spaces, as subsets to sets?

sum of subspaces  sim to union of subsets `should be non-disjoint?`
direct sum of subspaces sim to union of disjoint sets `can be subsets?`

vector space 

theory of finite-dimensional vector spaces
- linear Independence
- span 
- basis
- dimension


list vs point vs vector 

list can be thought of as point or vector (list not the same as point, vector which exist only in ordinary space or lower spaces?) 

vector translation is distinguishing property of vectors?

## 1.B
`How the motivations for the definitions of various mathematical objects like vector space come about? where do they usu come from`
[[basis]]

[[sum of subspaces]]
Sum of subspaces $U_{1}, \dots,U_{n}$ 
```
