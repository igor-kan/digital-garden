**Abstract:** This popular undergraduate quantum mechanics textbook is now available in a more affordable printing from Cambridge University Press. Unlike many other books on quantum mechanics, this text begins by examining experimental quantum phenomena such as the Stern-Gerlach experiment and spin measurements, using them as the basis for developing the theoretical principles of quantum mechanics. Dirac notation is developed from the outset, offering an intuitive and powerful mathematical toolset for calculation, and familiarizing students with this important notational system. This non-traditional approach is designed to deepen students' conceptual understanding of the subject, and has been extensively class tested. Suitable for undergraduate physics students, worked examples are included throughout and end of chapter problems act to reinforce and extend important concepts. Additional activities for students are provided online, including interactive simulations of Stern-Gerlach experiments, and a fully worked solutions manual is available for instructors
