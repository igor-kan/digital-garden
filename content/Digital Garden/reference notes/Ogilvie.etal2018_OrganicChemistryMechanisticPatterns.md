**Abstract:** Organic Chemistry: Mechanistic Patterns is the very first introductory organic chemistry title that holistically focuses on a mechanistic approach; an approach that has proven to achieve a deeper understanding of chemical reactivity. This mechanistic approach to the dynamic world of organic chemistry visualizes reactivity as a collection of patterns in electron movement, making it possible for students to describe why a reaction occurred. Recognizing patterns of electron flow between seemingly different reactions can allow students to predict how a chemical will react, even if they have never seen a particular reaction before. The text takes great care to establish a progression of reactivity, from simple to complex, introducing functional groups as necessary, while focusing on the reaction at hand rather than the various things that each functional group does. Together, we seek to open studentsâ€™ eyes to the dynamic world of organic chemistry with a more powerful and systematic approach to learning

Elimination and oxidation reactions in the formation of pi bonds.



Cancer cells 
- divide abnormally frequent, rapidly
- have elevated levels of fatty acid synthase (inset) to sustain the rapid growth.
	- fatty acid synthase is a target of some anti-cancer research, treatment.


fatty acid
- a building block of lipids and other biomolecules
- a building block of the cellular membrane, bi-lipid layer `lipid bi-layer?`
- 
[[fatty acid]] [[cellular membrane]] 
lipid
- a type of biomolecules in which energy is stored.
[[lipid]]

metabolism 
- a complex, interconnected `?` series of chemical processes `what types of processes?` inside a living organism that maintains its life.

[[metabolism]]

[[fatty acid synthase]]
- a multi-enzyme complex that catalyzes a stepwise series `?` of reactions to synthesize a fatty acid from a acetyl co-enzyme A (acetyl-SCoA) molecule. 



[[acetyl co-enzyme A]]
[[dehydration]]
fatty acid biosynthetic steps include
1. addition of ethanol(?) to the acetyl-SCoA
2. dehydration catalyzed by the dehydratase enzyme to remove elements of water molecule and form the pi bond.
3. dehydrated molecule is turned into a fatty acid



Ex. Simplified biosynthetic scheme from acetyl-SCoA to palmitate(16-C fatty acid); dehydratase- and fatty acid synthase- catalyzed.
