**Abstract:** 

map sending input to one and only one output is not the property that map has or doesnt, it'd definition of map
# Lec 2
prove : f is invertible iff f is bijective
prove: composition is associative 
identity map: X -> X (or domain can be a subset of X?)
- see below for more:
	- domain and codomain must be exactly the same set with same elements, b/c if Identity map sends domain X to some codomain Y which contains X, then Y and X are different sets and elements even if look the same are not unless X and Y explicitly assumed to be subsets of a common set.
	- domain and codomain must be the same set otherwise no ability to identify one object with another 
	- idea of encapsulation
def: of self-inverse maps, inverse of itself 

for composition, $g \circ f$ should codomain of f = domain of g (or can codomain of f be a subset of the domain of g?)

group of symmetries or permutations of X  - Bij(X,X)
- simple example of groups

permutation/symmetry group of/on X
- permutation adj used esp. when X has finite size e.g. permutation group of n elements wehre |x|=n

fixed point of map f
- concept exists only if maps form set to itself(explicitly to itself ) - only if self-maps 

map f: X-> X -- is self-map - sends set X to itself. so X is identical, exactly the same set as X. 
- linear operator - self-map of vector space



go to 1:44:20 - don't udnerstand explanation - similar in lec 3 27:20
- no assumption is made that elements of the set are the exactly same elements just because of their identity or intrinsic structure even  with "same" elements and same size, e.g. 1,2,3 and 1,2,3 or 1,2,3 and 1,2,3,4 
	- tendency to think they are exactly the same elements but in different sets only right when they are explicitly assumed to be in subsets of a larger set of numbers, so these elements in subsets are elements in the larger set and hence the same/identical
- is this the reason operations on sets are defined as operations on subsets only ??


# lec 3 

$\forall S, \emptyset \subseteq S$
then $\emptyset \subseteq \emptyset \text{ in both directions} \iff \emptyset = \emptyset$


makes no sense to intersect abstracts sets if they are not subsets of the same set. 
i.e. intersection defined only on subsets of some common set 


natural "inclusion" map

can binary operations be form X to different set Y?
binary operation : takes two elements from one set and maps them to an element in the same set
- e.g. cross product - basic type binary operation on vectors 
- but dot product is not binary operation on vectors - is bilinear form?

`since we take two inputs, these two inputs must be from one identical set? or two identical/different sets? in that case are these two sets combined with cartesian product, or is that only when operation is non-commutative?`

1:30 - def of group

![[_MAT240H1Lectures 2023-06-02 21.04.56.excalidraw]]

disjoint union operation doesn't require sets to be subsets of one set, can be arbitrary separated sets? - but keep in mind if two sets have similarly looking elements, they are not strictly same elements if these serts are not subsets of common set.  - assuming the two initial sets are disjoint 

# lec 4-5 , lec notes sets sl 16 -28

what "natural" means ?
- e.g. natural bijection, natural inclusion map

why alternative map definition in terms of graph(f) "is" (not actual definition? not most fundamental?)
can we have graph of some relation that is not a map (doesnt pass VLT)?


matrix represnation only possible with maps of starndard sets and labeleds sets ?
