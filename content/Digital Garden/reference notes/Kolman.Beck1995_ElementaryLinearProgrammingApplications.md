# Prologue

## Operations research
: a scientific method that provides a quantitative basis of decision making in a range of fields.
abbr. OR

Especially used in engineering and manufacturing. OR is used to find the optimal allocation of resources such as labor, energy, capital, raw materials, processing time, etc. 

## OR development
First developed during WWII by British government, and then continued by research groups of US for the military operations. During around that time first digital computers were created and developed in parallel with operations research methods. `was catalyzed by dev. of computers? or bi-directionally`

1947 - the simplex algorithm by George B. Danzigt `?`

1952 - the first solution of a LPP on a computer in the National Bureau of Standards SEAC machine `?`

1975 - T.C. Koopmans and L.V. Kantorovich received the Nobel Prize in Economics for their contributions to "the theory of optimum allocation of resources".
## Operational research study (process)

1. Problem definition and formulation.
	the decision alternatives
	limitations, restrictions, and requirements of the decision alternatives
2. Model construction
	represent the decision alternatives in terms of variables
	translate limitations, restrictions, and requirements of the decision alternatives into constraints
3. Solution of the model
	use well-known existing solution methods for the standard types of models and others
	use heuristic or approximate methods for unsolvable models by conventional methods
	modify the model 
4. Sensitivity analysis
	determine the sensitivity of the model solution/output to the changes in input data
5. Model evaluation
	
6. Implementation of the model


## The structure of mathematical models

model - an idealized representation of a real-life system that is being studied

May involve a reduction in scale, e.g. railroad models

Engineering 
the electrical analogue models 
- electrical properties substitute for mechanical properties
- e.g. resetting a dial to change the analogue of the mass of an object
