**Abstract:** Explains the theory and associated mathematics of quantum mechanics, discussing topics ranging from uncertainty and time dependence to particle and wave states.--

two-state system 
bit 
	basic logical unit
	cbit 
qubit
	analog for quantum system

mathematical degree of freedom
$$\sigma$$
arrows are used as another notation and don't imply any actual direction.

abstract coin, die have only 2 and 6 orientations/states respectively; actual physical objects can have continuously infinite number of states.


classical logic
proposition
AND - intersection
inclusive OR - union 
exclusive OR

for non-overlapping sets - AND statement/proposition? is false 

quantum logic
different; not based on the idea that the state of a system is a set??
only in certain limit, quantum space of states approximately reduces to a mathematical set concept (is vector space?)

vector space


phase space
state space

first system of interest
apparatus
	- second system
	- black box: how it works is of no interest, unknown 
	- detects, measures the system of interest
	- must be considered for quantum systems
	- usually ignored when describing classical systems except for experimental physics
