# 2
“accidental” features of specific potentials (the even spacing of energy levels for the harmonic oscillator

# 3
the uncertainty principle
the orthogonality of stationary states

linear algebra
[[vector space|linear space]]

wave function 
- abstract vector 
- the state of a system 
- possible physical state -> normalized 

n-tuple, nxn matrix `msut be nxn matrix transformation?` in n-dimensional space wrt the specified orthonormal basis

operator 
- linear transformation 


hermitian operator 
- observable 
- expectation value of an observable is real
- In a finite-dimensional vector space hermitian operators are represented by hermitian matrices; a hermitian matrix  
is equal to its transpose conjugate: T = T† = T˜∗


`stronger vs weaker definining condition in math `

expectation value 
expectancy 
expectation 
average
mean

inner product 
- dot product
- complex-valued 
- complex conjugate, transpose x column vector 
quantum mechanics 
- functions in the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space


finite-dimensional space 

finite-dimensional manipulations not well-behaved in the infinite-dimensional space:
- an infinite sum or integral of the inner product may not converge -> the inner product does not exist

[[Hilbert space]]


inner product of f with itself


`nonnormalizable -> not in Hilbert space?`

the integral Schwarz inequality
Frigyes Riesz and Bela Sz.-Nagy, Functional Analysis (Dover, Mineola, NY, 1990), Section 21. In a  
finite-dimensional vector space the Schwarz inequality, |α|β|2 ≤ α|α β|β, is easy to prove (see Problem A.5).  
But that proof assumes the existence of the inner products, which is precisely what we are trying to establish here.


orthonormal 
- normalized 
- mutually orthogonal 

complete 

The  
stationary states of the infinite square well (Equation 2.31) constitute a complete orthonormal  
set on the interval (0, a); the stationary states for the harmonic oscillator (Equation 2.68 or  
2.86) are a complete orthonormal set on the interval (-∞, ∞).


integration by parts 
boundary term 


hermitian conjugate (or adjoint) of an (not necessarily hermitian?) operator
