**Abstract:** 
# Intro - skiped
point-set topology - analogy-based theory   unifying and simplifying  makes accessible to our spatial imagination a great number of 
problems which are entirely abstract and non-intuitive to begin with. 

usual physical space, even when they do not actually take place there.

abstraction and logical thinking vs spatial 



specialization vs interweaving 

closeness vs vicinity vs convergence 

a differential geometer makes use of the fact that for each point and direction
there is exactly one geodesic  - the Existence and Uniqueness Theorem for systems of
second-order ordinary differential equations.

# 1.1
def topology 
why axiom - only 2 sets 

neighborhood vs open set 
a set is open if and only if all of its points are interior,
Show that the set of interior points of a set is always open.

verify right now that the interior of B is the union
of all open sets contained in B, and that the closure of B is the intersection of
all closed sets containing B.

"closed
sets", "neighborhoods" and "closure", can in its turn be used to characterize
openness. 

openness ~ topology structure 

a set B c X is open if and only if X\B is closed, if and only
if B is a neighborhood of each of its points, and if and only if X\B is equal to
its closure. Thus the system of axioms defining a topological space must be
expressible in terms of each one of these concepts,

# 1.2
notion of distance is defined; - metric given 

prove topology induced metric is topology 

around each point y such that d(xy y) < t there is a small <5-ball entirely
contained in the £-ball around x:
