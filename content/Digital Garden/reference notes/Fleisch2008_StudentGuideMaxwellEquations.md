Gauss's law for electric field /magnetic field 
Faraday's law of induction and ..

Ampere-Maxwell's law 


# 1.1
## E field

p5 field lines perpendicular to surface of conductor in equillibrium??

conducting vs insulating object like sphere 

number density, volumetric flow rate, velocity, fluid dynamics, particle flow rate or flux 

Jacobian, changing coordinate system, 

frequency and relative permittivity

polarization, response of dielectric to external applied electric field 

look, direction of electric field in non uniform insulating and conducting objects
