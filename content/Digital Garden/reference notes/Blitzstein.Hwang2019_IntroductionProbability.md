**Abstract:** "Undergraduate probability book that assumes one-semester of calculus. One key is the emphasis on "stories" for the probability distributions (which I mean in both an intuitive and technical sense): there are a dozen or so key distributions (Normal, Binomial, Poisson, etc.) that are incredibly widely-used in statistics, but a lot of books just write down formulas for them without explaining clearly why these particular distributions are so important, or how they are all connected. Each of these distributions has a "story" (a natural application where it arises), and thinking about stories makes the distributions easier to remember, understand, and work with"--
