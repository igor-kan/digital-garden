**Abstract:** Guided practice helps students develop into expert problem solvers The new 15th Edition of University Physics with Modern Physics, now in SI Units, draws on insights from several users to help students see patterns and make connections between problem types. Students learn to recognize when to use similar steps in solving the same problem type and develop an understanding for problem solving approaches, rather than simply plugging values into an equation. This edition addresses students' tendency to focus on the objects and situations posed in a problem, rather than recognizing the underlying principle or the problem type. New Key Concept statements identify the main idea used in examples to help students recognize the underlying concepts and strategy. New Key Example Variation Problems within new Guided Practice sections group problems by type so students recognize when problems can be solved in similar ways, regardless of wording or numbers
