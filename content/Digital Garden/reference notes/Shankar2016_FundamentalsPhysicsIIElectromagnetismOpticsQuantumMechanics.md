**Abstract:** R. Shankar, a well-known physicist and contagiously enthusiastic educator, was among the first to offer a course through the innovative Open Yale Course program. His popular online video lectures on introductory physics have been viewed over a million times. In this second book based on his online Yale course, Shankar explains essential concepts, including electromagnetism, optics, and quantum mechanics. The book begins at the simplest level, develops the basics, and reinforces fundamentals, ensuring a solid foundation in the principles and methods of physics

# Ch 1

what is benjamin franklin convention for charges and examples with rods etc
must know how to measure every symbol/quantity 

kilogram by definition

by definition = by arbitrary assignment = not right not wrong 
is there elementary unit of mass like e elementary charge? 

assuming spring force the same when measuring the mass `how do we know how force related to x (assuming Hooke's law not given ? key is that it is the same so exact epxression not needed for force`

force constant k


F=mg is not the same as F=ma, it's left side i.e. like F=-kx 
must be mg b/c say F_g not known but if divided by m you must get g -> must be mg

two glasses rubbed with fur repel
one rubber rubbed with fur, silk repels or attracts to glass 
above objects attract with metal on nylon thread but after contact repel

metals on nylon string attracted -> no change after contacting them with nylon -> attraction disappears when contacting them with wire 

theory of electrostatics 


electrostatic force is $10^{40}$ stronger gravitational 

Coulomb's law
- separation r is much larger than individual sizes of charges -> therefore treated as point particles, point charges 
- assume either mathematical point charges or real charges with finite sizes but separated by large distance and r is from center to center(by convention; doesn't matter a lot )

coulomb unit 
- large b/c historic reasons, connected to current
- two 1 C charges separated by 1 m

$F_{21}$ on 2 due to 1

$\mathbf{e}_{r}$

(local conservation of ) charge is conserved 
- extra term, qualification -> local 

non-local conservation ?
	- charge disappear and reappear in different place; is it the same charge that traveled? is it traveled? e.g. proton to positron 
in relativity, conservation makes no sense? -> b/c not simultaneous in every frame of reference - special relativity theory 


conservec = doesn't change with time 


extra assumption we make we are not supposed to, not consequence of any logic  -> superposition 

superposition - sum of vectors: the force between 2 charges is not affected by the third charge presence 
- not logical requirement
- not true at extremely accurate level - good approximation that found experimentally
- 
Coulomb's law -> for two point charges at a time

rod - extended object 

polarization - separation of opposite charges

which materials dont' polarize ?

prefactor - number in front of order of magnitude ?

force of gravity is not shielded  


dark matter halo of galaxy

can inverse square law for fields proven by density of field lines ?
## 1.4 mostly skipped 1.4-1.6
local conservation law 
- interpolating trajectory 
- enclosed region and boundary notion? p10 -2

```
take value vs take on value
```

charge quantization
- Dirac - magnetic monopoles, qm


# Ch. 2
special relativity 
instantaneous vs simultaneous communication 

light signal
`anything can be light signal in distance forces?`
time of travel, transit of signal info


coulomb's law at small distances 
and at large distances but only with static charges 


E vecotor - property of condition at the tail of vector point 

what information is lost, gained from one or another diagram, drawing interpretation (e.g. contours, faraday field lines=flow lines?, vector field by points)

density of lines 

only in R^3, where area prop to r^2, density of lines spreading coincides with decline in force 


field line when arbitrarily close to one charge, arbirtrary large field  1/r^2

perpendicular bisector 

https://youtu.be/xnSc_OWpCuY?list=PLD07B2225BB40E582&t=3203 
`distance appears in numerator and denominator b/c formula has same dimensions? i.e. extra m dimension in numerator (a) cancelled out by extra x in denom?`

## skipped 2.2

## 2.3

spacetime point
retarded interaction 

## 15.9
$V$ and $\mathbf{A}$ are entangled?

# Ch. 18


1801 - Thomas Young 
the ray theory of light
wave amplitude 

light intensity = (wave amplitude)^2

Double-slit interference pattern in the oscillatory light intensity from both slits requires conditions:
- (One) definite light wavelength, i.e. monochromatic light. 
	- mixture of wavelengths, e.g. sunlight, will reduce interference, maxima and minima `?`, disrupt wavelength-dependence of maxima and minima locations. `is some varying with lambda preserved when there is a dominating maximum intensity wavelength in the mixture? `
- Light wavelength must be comparable to `?` or larger than the size of the slits `both?` or `and?` the spacing $d$ between the slits.




`?`
rapid oscillations -> probe(not microscopic, e.g. eyes) detects the average of the interference pattern  $I_{1+2}$, i.e. the sum of two intensities. $I_{1}+I_{2}$`same for water waves?` `this line in the window eye case?`

monochromatic light through two large slits(e.g. windows) could `why, how in principle?` have interference pattern at some point on the detecting screen but with microscopic spacing between troughs and crests. Ordinary macroscopic probes(e.g. eyes) will spatially average the  $I_{1+2}$ over many cycles  `pattern shifts over cycles? why number of cycles and rapid oscillations contribute to the averaging effect?`

x responds to y force - x is described by y force

inhomogeneous linear wave equation
wave responds to internal `how?` and external(source) forces

## Capacitance

U=qV? 
v1, v2 no matter where start and end
potential difference V or $\Delta V$ 
$$V=\frac{Q}{C} $$ 1/C - constant of proportionality
C - capacitance 

infinite two plate capacitor 
$\Delta V = E d=\frac{\sigma}{\upepsilon_{0}}d$
$$\sigma = \frac{Q}{A}$$

$C=\frac{\upepsilon_{0}A}{d}$

$dW=\frac{Q}{C}dQ$
integral of that is total energy of capacitor  
V diff = work to move 1 C

two concentric spheres 
field integrate -> V diff -> 



not always calculable? irregular metallic objects 

$U=\frac{\upepsilon_{0}E^2}{2}Ad$

u = energy density of electric field (capacitors, electromagnetic waves)
electric field cannot just disappear b/c law of conservation of energy 

how current is constant along the wire `how varying curent by position evens out ?`

$\Delta V$ is zero over closed loop b/c integral of conservative electric field over  loop is 0
