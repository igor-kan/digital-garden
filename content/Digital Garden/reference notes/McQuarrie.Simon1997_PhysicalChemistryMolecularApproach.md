## TMP 1.7
HUP 
not in macroscopic b/c absolute value of x and p are big compared to uncertainty? dx and dp uncertainty big too?
at micro uncertainties are smaller, and product comparable, close to $\frac{\hbar}{2}$

infinite certainty 
- uncertainty = 0 

Bohr model 
- Rydberg constant
- average distance (radius?) and energy of H atom 
- b/c of HUP, need more general theory

## tmp 1

## TMP 2.1-3
general classical wave equation 
- vibrating string 
- 



displacement of wave `element?` - `aka coloquially amplitude of wave?`

reference value, point, equilibrium  def?

order -> max power of derivatives
ordinary and partial
differential equation - w/ derivatives of a function def? `unknown is a function?` 

assume - separation of variables 


function independent of x vs. func is for all x

func of x = only dependent on x
If function of x and its derivatives wrt to x = function of y and its derivatives wrt to y
- since equality is true for all x and y
- LHS is independent of y -> RHS too  (same for x) 
- both sides independent of x and y -> equal to constant?

why constant is of form -b^2



general to specific solution 
boundary condition 
apply boundary conditions of the problem for specific solution (can be solved w/o boundary conditions?)
- derive restrictions for spatial and temporal parts `parts also waves?`
- imposes quantization in $\beta$ as integer multiple of pi/length

X(0) 
- X(x) - linear combination of $\sin(\beta x)$ $\cos(\beta x)$? sin and cos linearly dependent b/c there is nontrivial solution to X(x) = 0 iff $\beta=\frac{n\pi}{l}$(trivial solution coef of sin = 0);and independent when $\beta \neq \frac{n\pi}{l}$
- X(0) = 0: sin is zero -> holds for all coef of sin; cos(0)=1 -> cos coef must be 0

phase factor, relative magnitudes `how derived?` $\phi$ in terms of ratio of relative amplitudes of sin and cos
- Acos Bsin into Ccos function 
- https://www.desmos.com/calculator/6nu06wu7xa

is cos sin product for all n -> set of u_n solutions =  basis vectors for  basis for solution space?
u_n - normal mode (solution)
- if only A_n non-zero, only u_n is soln then standing wave 
- u = lin comb = set of A_n and phase factors_n
physical meaning of A_n




stationary states - energy eigenstates

correspondence principle

mystery q HO
- tails non-zero b/c exponential term
- evenly spaced energy levels
- some nodes with zero value - energy?
- 
- 
- QHO
- - consistent with HUP


completeness theorem 

inner product
outer product



superpposition state 

time evolution - motion


basis function, eigenstate, wavefunction 

# Particle in a box


## tmp 3.5
why cos and sin are soln to ode d2f=-k2f

then solve coefficients a and b like classical wave eqn 
boundary conditions -> continuity of wavefunction 

one quantization n from arcsin
- n quantum number 

## tmp 3.8 - skipped 


## Average position
[tmp 3.9]
