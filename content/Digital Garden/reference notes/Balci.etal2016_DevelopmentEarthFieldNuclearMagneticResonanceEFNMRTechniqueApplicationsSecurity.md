**Abstract:** In this work Earth’s field nuclear magnetic resonance (EFNMR) technique for applications in security scanning devices has been presented. The EFNMR setup has been build based on Magritek low-frequency (0–1 MHz) KEA-2 NMR console. Excepting the NMR console, all components are home-made units, which are a first-order gradiometer RF probe, pre-polarization system, magnetic field shimming system, RF shielding box and passive filters. Our measurements have shown that even in very noisy lab conditions the EFNMR signals of small amounts (~5 ml) of liquid samples could be measured. EFNMR measurements of various liquids have been performed and their spin–lattice T1 and spin–spin T2 relaxation constants have been obtained. A possibility to detect, at the same time, both fluorine and proton resonance has been shown by EFNMR measurements of trifluoroacetic acid. A good spectral resolution of EFNMR setup has been demonstrated by the spectroscopic measurements of heteronuclear J-coupling of trimethyl phosphate and fluorobenzene. Furthermore, we have shown that the EFNMR measurements of T1 and T2 constants as well as heteronuclear J-coupling of liquids enclosed in metallic containers are feasible. Possible applications of the EFNMR technique in security scanners for the detection of illicit and energetic substances are discussed.
