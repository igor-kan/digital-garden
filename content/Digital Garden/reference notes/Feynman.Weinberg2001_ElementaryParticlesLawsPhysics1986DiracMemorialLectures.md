**Abstract:** 



Feynman giving the Dirac Memorial lecture in 1986 and this is probably the closest we'll ever get to answering my question. Perhaps the fact that Dirac used pure mathematics to answer a question about physics was what made Feynman regarding him as truly exceptional. It's worthwhile to note that RPF always based his ideas on unparallelled physical intuition, with the math coming afterwards, but it seemed to be the opposite with Dirac at least in the case of antiparticles.

RPF says the following (I attempt to transcribe from the lecture, please bear with me):

"When I was a young man, Dirac was my hero. He made a new breakthrough, a new method of doing physics, .. was to guess an equation. Previous to that Maxwell got his equations, but only in an enormous mass of gearwheels .. and so forth .. to understand what he was doing. But Dirac had the courage to simply guess at the form of the equation and try to interpret it afterwards."

When Feynman was trying to formulate path integral of quantum mechanics, he was inspired by Dirac's remark which roughly states that eiS‚Ñè
corresponds to the transition amplitude, where S
 is the action.
