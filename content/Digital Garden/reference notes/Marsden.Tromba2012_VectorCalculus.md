```
surface
regular / smooth surface
torus
torus parameterization
why u, v to parametiration in xyz? what does uv graph represent?

```

Example 
Find the tangent at (u,v) for the torus



```
Green's theorem with multiple boundary components 

a distincino of path vs. curve 
sim to distincion between surface vs regular parametrization ?



how to determine the direction of the circular path (is it by considering the definitions of functions that parametrize it?)
```
