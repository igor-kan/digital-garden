# Preface and notation
Author's purposes, emphasis:
- prepare for, learn from the experimental methods and data: optical, radar, radio, X-ray, infrared observations 
	- new generation of tests: artificial satellites of the sun, the Earth, etc.  
- more systematic, fundamental approach to the theory of gravitation and general relativity 
	- not starting with Riemannian(differential) geometry as the fundamental basis approach but with the principle of equivalence even theough Riemannian manifold approach was first used by Einstein 
		- 
	- principle of equivalence 
		- derived experimentally
		-  bridge between fundamental particle physics and gravitation (general relativity)
		- strong, weak, electromagnetic forces are not understood in Riemannian geometry terms as Einstein hoped
		- geometric objects like the metric, the affine connection, the curvature tensor are naturally found and Riemannian geometry  is a tool in the gravitation theory and general relativity based on the principle 
		- from this below follows (not just that space-time is a Riemannian manifold; or only from it?)
			metric tensor represents the gravitational field 
			freely falling particle moves on geodesics 
			field equations are generally covariant 
		- gravitation obeys the principle of equivalence 
			- seems not to be explained by classical mechanics, Riemannian geometry, etc.
			- seems to be explained by the laws, constraints of the quantum theory of gravitation   
				- has a quantum basis 
				-  seems impossible to construct a Lorentz-invariant quantum theory of particles of mass 0 and spin 2 unless the corresponding classical field obeys the principle of equivalence 
Omitted:
- most of detailed derivations, classifications of exact solutions of the Einstein's field equations 
	- mostly not needed for fundamental understanding of gravitation theory 
- details on gravitational collapse theorems by Penrose and Hawking

- section with asterisk can be skipped in a first reading
