For a finite measure space $E$ and a pointwise convergent sequence of measurable functions $\{f_n\}$ to a real-valued function $f$ on $E$, for any $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a closed subset $F \subseteq E$ such that $\{f_n\} \rightarrow f$ uniformly on $F$ and $m(E \setminus F) < \varepsilon$.

Lemma: for each $\eta > 0$ and $\delta > 0$, there exists a measurable subset $A \subseteq E$ and an index $N$ such that $|f_n - f| < \eta$ for all $n \geq N$ and $m(E \setminus A) < \delta$.
