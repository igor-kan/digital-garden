[[power set axiom]]
[[ZFC]] 

the class of hereditary, well-founded sets. 




shows how model of ZFC set theory would look like it exists 
doesn't convincingly show there exists such a model 

---

1. iterating power set operation countable number of times from initial ordinal 
2. take countable union ``from the last limit ordinal ? ``
3. repeat 

$V_{\omega +1}=\mathcal{P}(V_{\omega})$ `philosophical problems?`



$V_{\alpha}$

$|V_{n+1}|=2^{|V_{n}|}$ `?`

$\alpha$ 
- inaccessible cardinal iff is not a successor to any cardinal 
	- can it be shown they exist? 
	- for all inaccessible cardinals(if exists) there is a model of ZFC set theory given $\mathcal{P}$ is well-defined 
- regular $\Leftrightarrow \alpha \neq \bigcup_{\beta<\alpha}\beta$ 
- 
$V=\bigcup_{\alpha}V_{\alpha}$ `thm? from the first-order logic? axiom of foundation ?`

sets can be informally pictured as trees 
- `point/root for zero/empty-set?`
- may have infinite number of branches by [[infinity set|infinity axiom]]
- finite length branches due to [[foundation axiom]]

Issues 
	What $\mathcal{P}(\text{infinite set})$ actually is? 
	Do $\alpha$ inaccessible cardinals exist?
