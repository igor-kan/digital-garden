I am a senior student at the University of Toronto, majoring in Physics and Mathematics. This site is a showcase of my journey and experiences and a 'digital garden'ðŸª´ where I cultivate and share my ongoing [[Education|studies]] and [[Projects|projects]] with focus on mathematics and statistics, while also encompassing a broad range of subjects from quantum mechanics to artificial intelligence.
