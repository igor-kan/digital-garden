title: Hi, I'm Igor.

I am a senior student at the University of Toronto, majoring in Physics and Mathematics. This site is a showcase of my journey and experiences and a 'digital garden'ðŸª´ where I cultivate and share my ongoing [[Education|studies]] and [[Projects|projects]] with focus on mathematics and statistics, while also encompassing a broad range of subjects from quantum mechanics to artificial intelligence.

**Note**: This website is in its nascent stage, currently being populated with notes from ongoing interests and studies in areas such as real analysis, PDEs, statistics, numerical analysis, geophysics/geography, and artificial intelligence. It serves as a digital gardenâ€”a personal tool for learning and sharing, akin to a blog. The content is organized in a manner inspired by the [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) method, facilitating a network of interconnected, informally written, semantics-centered notes.
